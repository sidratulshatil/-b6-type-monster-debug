                    <div class="accordion-body"> <strong>Local storage :-</strong> is the most recent mechanism. It
                        allows
                        for larger amounts
                        of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is
                        useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. <br>

                        <strong>Session storage :-</strong> is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the
                        current session. This
                        means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful
                        for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.

                        The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables
                        and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                        that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br>
                        <strong>Block Scope :-</strong>
                        Block scope is a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                        variables inside the <span class="text-info">curly brackets { }</span>. Now, these curly
                        brackets
                        can be of loops, or
                        conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from
                        within the <span class="text-info">curly brackets { }</span>.

                    <div class="accordion-body">Call stack holds all the synchronous function calls. Call stack will
                        execute code in a last in first out approach. So last the most inner nested code will be
                        executed first and then one level above that and so on. If the function call is asynchronous it
                        will add a new call entry on WebAPIs and the API will add a new call to the callback queue after
                        the asynchronous action is done.

                        Now we have two stacks with functions to be executed. This is where the Event Loop comes in.
                        Event Loop's job is to watch Callback Queue and Call Stack, whenever Call Stack is empty and we
                        have called in Callback Queue. The event loop will move calls to Call Stack and execute them in
                        succession.
                        So to explain it in different terms, the event loop will wait until all blocking/synchronous
                        code is done and then add asynchronous calls into the call stack. This simple architectural
                        approach is what allows javascript to handle way more requests than the traditional
                        multi-threaded synchronous approach
