                    <div class="accordion-body"> <strong>Local storage :-</strong> is the most recent mechanism. It
                        allows
                        for larger amounts
                        of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is
                        useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. <br>

                        <strong>Session storage :-</strong> is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the
                        current session. This
                        means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful
                        for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.

                        The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables
                        and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                        that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br>
                        <strong>Block Scope :-</strong>
                        Block scope is a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                        variables inside the <span class="text-info">curly brackets { }</span>. Now, these curly
                        brackets
                        can be of loops, or
                        conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from
                        within the <span class="text-info">curly brackets { }</span>.
